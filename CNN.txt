Task: Digit Recognition
Dataset: MNIST
Model: CNN (2 convs + 2 fully connected layers)
Summary:
a. Elastic deformations have a considerable impact on performance. (++)
This could also imply that the evaluation dataset is too small to infer the generalization properly.
b. Affine transformation is also good for recognition. (+)
